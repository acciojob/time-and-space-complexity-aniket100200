	<h1>Time Complexity and Space Complexity</h1>
		<p>
			Time Complexity is the way of describing perticular algorithm performance withing perticular test cases.
			There are Three Types of Time complexities as following 1] Best time 2]Averge Time 3] Worst Time
			Best Time for minimal input the best performance of the program. and Average means for best as worst cases. and worst means for 
			worst case the the time complexity.
			Generally the time complexity are O(1),O(logn),O(n),O(n<sup>2</sup>),O(n<sup>3</sup>),O(2<sup>n</sup>)
		</p>

	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> is the measure of the Space used by perticualr program to run an Algorithm.
		There are many algorthims and Space complexities are related to them such as we have linear Space complexity which is O(n) and this is in worst case and where n represents
		number of the Elements
